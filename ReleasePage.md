## 0.2.0 ##

Release 0.2.0 provides a new GUI, which will be the main interaction method going forward.  It also supports exporting SMS, memos and contacts as XML, text or csv.

## 0.1.1 ##

Release 0.1.1 is an update to fix a crash some people (including me) have been having.  Specifically, issue [2](http://code.google.com/p/ipddump/issues/detail?id=2)

## 0.1.0 ##

Release 0.1.0 is basically just the release I wanted when I started this project.  It takes any IPD Blackberry dump and outputs a CSV formatted list of your SMS messages.
