# Feature Requests #

Add any features you'd like to see along with a brief explanation using the [issues](http://code.google.com/p/ipddump/issues/list) page.  I intend to implement reading the records as people request them.  For instance, the calendar records, or address book records, etc.

For reference, below is the list of types of records (technically called databases) in a typical IPD.
